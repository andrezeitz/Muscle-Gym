## Structure of the website

## Wireframes
I used website wireframe.cc to creat a wireframe.

### Desktop

## Changes to Wireframes Design as the Project Progressed
As the wireframes are just basic sketches for each page I did some changes over the course of the project.

* Took away the "discount box" that was supposed to be on the hero cover photo.
* Made a hamburger menu for tablet and mobile instead of having the nav-bar under the logo.
* Deleted the location map that was supposed to be on the home page and have it only on the contact us page.


## Design

### Colors
Main colour used in project:
* Background color: #FFFFF and #000000
* Font colors: #3A3A3A, #FFFFFF and #B8100A 
* Membership box color: Gold rbg(255,215,0) and silver rbg(192,192,192)

#### Contrast Checker

I match #3A3A3A font color with the #FFFFFF background here is the result in contrast check:

I match #FFFFFF font color with the #000000 background. Here is the result in contrast check:!

I use #B8100A for large text that is ok contrast to the background.

## Features

The website has below features:

### Navigation bar
* Navigation bar is visible on the top of each website for big screens.
* Navigation bar will turn to a burger menu on smaller screen. (Tried to get the menu under the logo but since I have 4 links it was to tight so I decided to get a burger menu instead)
* Navigation scheme:
##### On the right side is four links.(Burger menu for smaller screen) It contains:
* Home
* About us
* Classes and Membership
* Contact us

### Home
The home page contains a big hero picture with full width for all screens.
After the picture there is a lot of information about the gym. The topics are weight training, general fitness and functional training.

### About us
On this side we go in little bit futher on our story for the gym, what we do and what our customers can expect from the gym.
It cointains four sub headings. Our story, Customer service, What we do and Culture.
After that we show our personal trainers with some informations about them. 

### Classes and Membership
Classes and Membership side start with a presentation of our three popular classes. They are spinning, circuit traning and zumba.
All classes have some information on what we do and what the customer can expect from the class.
Finnaly we have the membership section where the customer have two choises. Either they can sign up for the silver membership or the gold membership.
Both membership show information on what you get and prices.

### Contact us
The contact us page is just a simple contact form so the customer easy can get in contact with the gym. It cointans first name, last name, email, phone number that is optional. After that we have 3 check boxes that can be clicked on what the customer want more information about. They are "classes, personal trainers and general informaton". Last is the text box where the customer can write all there questions inside.

### Different Screen Size
I was using Chrome as my main browser and the website have been tested on my iPhone 11 Pro and Macbook Pro 13¨.

I also tested the website inside of Chrome Dev Tools. With different px sizes to make sure the website will work on all different devices.

## Issues found during site development
Problem to get the site to size good after width 400px, photos will not shrink down to the correct size.

## Deployment
The site was developed on Gitpod, using GitHub for version control and hosting the repository and final site. The repository for this project, and the associated workspace, was created from the Code Institute template.
