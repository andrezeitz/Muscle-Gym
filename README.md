#  Muscle Gym

## User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

<hr>

Muscle Gym is a website for anyone that is looking for a really clean and modern gym in central Stockholm. The gym just opened it doors to the public and want with this website to try to get more customers to find it.

This website can not be used as a template for a business since its a project for educational purposes.
This website will be build with HTML and CSS only.

# UX

## Website owner business goals

The reason to create this website is to make the public know more about this brand new gym in Stockholm. The website will show opening times, prices for different subcreation options and location to the gym.

## User goals

### New user goals:

## Structure of the website

The website is made so it should be easy for anyone to use the website on any devices. There should not be any differens on the user experience to use desktop, mobile or tablet on the website. 

## Wireframes
I used website wireframe.cc to creat a wireframe.
