#  Muscle Gym

Muscle Gym is a website for anyone that is looking for a really clean and modern gym in central Stockholm. The gym just opened it doors to the public and wants with this website to try to get more customers. On this website, you can find all information you need to become a new member.

This website can not be used as a template for a business since it's a project for educational purposes.
This website has been build with HTML and CSS.

## Structure of the website

The website is made so it should be easy for anyone to use the website on any devices. There should not be any differens for the user to use desktop, mobile or tablet on the website. 

## Wireframes
I used website wireframe.cc to create a wireframe.

### Desktop
![1-Homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/121511290-c3d45400-c9e8-11eb-8fab-9b2b1e3bd588.png)
![2-Classes-and-Price](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/121511296-c46cea80-c9e8-11eb-9c9d-2f33185b370c.png)

### Mobile

![6-About-us-and-Contact-Mobile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/121511303-c59e1780-c9e8-11eb-8c15-693a28d8dbfb.png)

## Changes to Wireframes Design as the Project Progressed
As the wireframes are just basic sketches for each page I made some changes over the course of the project.

* I took away the "discount box" that I had orignal included on the wireframe.
* I made a hamburger menu for tablet and mobile instead of having the nav-bar links under the logo.
* I removed the location map on the wireframe homepage and have it placed only on the contact us page.


## Design

### Colors
For the best impact I use this colors.
* Background color: #FFFFF and #000000
* Font colors: #3A3A3A, #FFFFFF and #B8100A 
* Membership box color: Gold rbg(255,215,0) and silver rbg(192,192,192)

#### Contrast Checker

I match #3A3A3A font color with the #FFFFFF background here is the result in contrast check:
![Skärmavbild 2021-06-28 kl  13 51 34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/123632287-0e8f0200-d818-11eb-973c-07fd5db2f7be.png)

I match #FFFFFF font color with the #000000 background. Here is the result in contrast check:
![Skärmavbild 2021-06-28 kl  13 50 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/123632997-e8b62d00-d818-11eb-9d96-ad8df40fbdab.png)

This color would not be suitable for smaller text but it works fine with big text. I know it would be wrong to use it on small text.

### Fonts
* As a main font I used Cairo and Rubik, and as backup font sans-serif

### Images
* I used free images from google.com and pexels.com

## Features

The website has the following features:

### Navigation bar
* Navigation bar is visible on the top of each website for big screens.
* Navigation bar will turn to a burger menu on smaller screen. (Tried to get the menu under the logo but since I have 4 links it was to tight so I decided to get a burger menu instead)
* Navigation scheme:
##### On the right side is four links.(Burger menu for smaller screen) It contains:
* Home
* About us
* Classes and Membership
* Contact us

### Home
The home page contains a big hero picture with full width for all screens.
Below the picture there is a lot of information about the gym. The topics are weight training, general fitness and functional training.

![Skärmavbild 2021-07-06 kl  11 28 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/124577189-4ec03700-de4d-11eb-90d8-b1ff06df7e0a.png)


### About Us
In this section we go delve a little further into our story for the gym, what we do and what our customers can expect from the gym.
It contains four subheadings. Our story, Customer service, What we do and Culture.
We display images of our personal trainers with some information about them.

![Skärmavbild 2021-06-29 kl  13 18 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/123788621-87579200-d8dc-11eb-88ae-77db9a0fee43.png)


### Classes and Membership
Classes and Membership section starts with a presentation of our three popular classes. These are spinning, circuit training and zumba.
Each box has information about what they can expect from the class.
Finally we displayed the membership section where the customer has two choices. Either they can sign up for the silver membership or the gold membership.
Both memberships show information on what you get and prices. I decided to give the gold membership a slightly more exclusive look then the silver with the intention of getting as many customers as possible to choose the gold membership.

![Skärmavbild 2021-06-29 kl  13 19 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/123788696-9a6a6200-d8dc-11eb-91ac-10ea60cb3689.png)


### Contact Us
The contact us page is just a simple contact form so the customer easy can get in contact with the gym. It contains first name, last name, email and phone number that is optional for the customer. After that we have 3 radio buttons that the customer can click to indicate their information preference. They are "general information, classes and personal trainers". Last is a required text box where the customer can write all there questions inside.
On the bottom they will see a google maps to show where the gym is located (fake location for this project).

### Form Success
The success page of the form is proof for the customer to know that we have received their message. We also explain that we will get in touch with them as soon as possible. It also have a link so the customer can easily get back to the home website.

### Code Validation
#### HTML
The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to validate the HTML on every page of the project. On the first validation some issues were flagged on the contact-us.html and these were resolved as explained below:

index.html with no problems found:

![index validator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/123604368-11c7c500-d7fb-11eb-9791-639e43775b27.png)

contact-us.html was flagged on some issues with the the code inside the iframe that is to display the google maps. After checking the errors they where fixed and had after that no errors.

![Skärmavbild 2021-06-29 kl  14 41 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/123799268-567d5a00-d8e8-11eb-89e7-63bfacb6bec6.png)

form-success.html with no problems found

#### CSS
The W3C CSS Validation Service was used to validate the CSS file used for the project. There were no errors found.
![Skärmavbild 2021-06-29 kl  10 57 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/123769024-25d9f800-d8c9-11eb-90c5-0a5b47c9b628.png)


### Different Screen Size
I was using Chrome as my main browser and the website have been tested on my iPhone 11 Pro and Macbook Pro 13¨.

I also tested the website inside of Chrome Dev Tools. With different px sizes to make sure the website will work on all different devices.

## Issues found during site development
* I had an issue with the navigation bar after the size screen went smaller than 800px width the navigation link could not really fit even if I put it under the icon, so I decided to change it to a burger menu to have it looks sleek.

![Skärmavbild 2021-06-29 kl  13 02 38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85236391/123786728-4fe7e600-d8da-11eb-9de4-f6016424f481.png)

* One other problem was the right side picture in the home section. After the screen size went down to 1200px the picture start to shrink on the height and did not really look good. I decided that the picture will jump down under the home text after 1200px and then for mobile phones I choice to change the picture to a smaller one to really fit the mobile size.

* I decided to use radio buttons instead of checkboxs so the customer only had one choise to choose from in the contact us form. If I went with checkboxes I would need to use more javascript to be able to choose how many boxes the customer was able to click and since I tried to use HTML and CSS as much as possible I decided radio buttons was better. You can see the result here [Contact Us](#contact-us)

* I wanted to be able to make all of the nav-bar links a .active status but since "Home, About us and Classes & Membership" is on the same page it was tricky. After talking with a tutor he told me it's not possible to do it without using even more JavaScript. Since it's outside of the scope for this project I decided to only highlight the home button on the index.html. You can see the result here [Home](#home)
